      <li>OIL</li>
      <li>POTATO</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>STEPS</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large mixing bowl add 2 cups of whole wheat flour, 1 teaspoon of
        oil or ghee, ½ teaspoon of salt.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add ½ cup water in portions as you go on mixing and kneading the dough.
        Keep in mind not to add all of the water at once.
      </li>
      <li>
        Mix and knead into a smooth, soft dough. Continue to add a bit more
        water a splash at a time if required while kneading. Cover with a
        kitchen towel and set the dough aside to rest for 30 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Use a rolling pin to roll the paratha dough into a circle thats about 4
        inches in diameter.
      </li>
      <li>
        Next, use the back of a spoon to spread some ghee (or oil) to coat the
        surface of the dough circle.
      </li>
      <li>
        Once youve rolled out all of the paratha dough discs or square, heat a
        tawa (skillet) over medium heat on the stovetop. Working one at a time,
        place one of the paratha onto the tawa. To test the hotness of the
        skillet, sprinkle a few pinches of flour in the center. if it browns in
        a few seconds, the tawa is hot enough to begin with the paratha
        roasting. With a kitchen napkin, wipe off these browned flour particles
        from the skillet before you begin roasting paratha.
      </li>
    </ol>
